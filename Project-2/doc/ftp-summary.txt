FTP may run in active or passive mode, which determines how the data connection is established.
In both cases, the client creates a TCP control connection from a random, usually an unprivileged, 
port N to the FTP server command port 21.

In active mode, the client starts listening for incoming data connections from the server on port M. 
It sends the FTP command PORT M to inform the server on which port it is listening. 
The server then initiates a data channel to the client from its port 20, the FTP server data port.

In situations where the client is behind a firewall and unable to accept incoming TCP connections, 
passive mode may be used. In this mode, the client uses the control connection to send a PASV command 
to the server and then receives a server IP address and server port number from the server,
which the client then uses to open a data connection from an arbitrary client port to the server IP 
address and server port number received.

The server responds over the control connection with three-digit status codes in ASCII 
with an optional text message. For example, "200" (or "200 OK") means that the last command was successful.
The numbers represent the code for the response and the optional text represents a human-readable explanation 
or request (e.g. <Need account for storing file>).An ongoing transfer of file data over the data connection 
can be aborted using an interrupt message sent over the control connection.
